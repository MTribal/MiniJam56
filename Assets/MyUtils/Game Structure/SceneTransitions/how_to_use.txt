----------------> Scene Transitions <---------------

Description:
	- A package that helps make awesome and smooth transitions between scenes.

Folder Content:
	- Animation -> Animations used in pre-made transition effects.
	- Prefabs -> All prefabs and pre-made transition models of the package.
	- Scripts -> Really the scripts used in the package.

When to use:
	- Use when you want transition between two scenes smoothly.

How to use:

	- Each scene in your game need a "TransitionEffect" model. You can found one in "Prefabs/TransitionModels".
		- Choose a effect model and put in your scenes or create your own custom model.
		- Then configure each transition individually in all your scenes by changing "SceneLoader" parameters in "TransitionEffect" gameObject.

	- First level (normally "MainMenu") need a "TransitionManager" prefab. It's a undestructable manager that manage important parameters.

	- You can also load a scene via script, using 'SceneLoader.Instance.(SomeLoadFunction)'.
	
	* Creating custom "TransitionEffect" models *
		- Make two animations
			-> Start level (load when level starts)
			-> Exit level (load when level exits)

		- Create a "Animator-Override_Controller"
		- Set parent controller parameter as "DefaultSceneTransition" controller.
		- Link the animations you made.
		- Link the controller to your gameObject and configure the animations.
		- Make a prefab of your gameObject to create a model (prefab must contain a canvas). 
		- Look at the default TransitionModels in "Prefabs/TransitionModels" to see an example.

Script Reference:
	ENUMS:
		LoadType -> The type of load of some transition. { Transition -> Transition between different scenes, Reload -> Load the same scene }
		[Where to use -> Use to store if a transition is between scenes or reloading the scene.]

		Transition -> The type of a transition, animated or not.  {Animated, NotAnimated }
		[Where to use -> Use to store if a transition is animated or not]

	MONO:
		SceneLoader -> Load scenes and trigger transitions effects when it exists.
		[Where to use -> Each scene need a instance of it. You can found one in "Prefabs/TransitionModels"]

		TransitionManager -> Store LoadType and TransitionType of all transitions. SceneLoader uses this parameters.
		[Where to use -> You should have only one instance of it, and should be in the first scene of the game as a undestructable manager.]
		[You can find a prefab of it in "Prefabs/TransitionManager".]
